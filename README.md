## Mini-Lsm 

**This is a forked repository from [skyzh/mini-lsm](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm). Starter folder includes my implementation of mini-lsm.**


## Demo

You can run the reference solution by yourself to gain an overview of the system before you start.

```
cargo run --bin mini-lsm-cli-ref
cargo run --bin mini-lsm-cli-mvcc-ref
```

And we have a compaction simulator to experiment with your compaction algorithm implementation,

```
cargo run --bin compaction-simulator-ref
cargo run --bin compaction-simulator-mvcc-ref
```
